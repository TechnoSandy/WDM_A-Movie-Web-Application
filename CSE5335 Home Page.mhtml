<h1>Programming Assignment 2<br>
A Movie Web Application</h1>
Due on Tuesday October 9 before midnight<br>
Worth 5% of your final grade
</center>
<hr>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
This project must be done individually. No copying is permitted. The
goal of this project is to learn client-side web programming using
JavaScript and AJAX.  More specifically, you will create
a Web application that displays information about movies.
</p>
This project must be done individually. No copying is permitted.=20
<b>Note: We will use a system for detecting software plagiarism, called
<a href=3D"http://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/" target=3D"_top">Moss</a=
>,
which is an automatic system for determining the similarity of programs.</b=
>
That is, your program will be compared with the programs of the other stude=
nts in class
as well as with the programs submitted in previous years. This program will=
 find
similarities even if you rename variables, move code, change code structure=
, etc.
<p></p>
<p>
Note that, if you use a Search Engine to find similar programs on the web, =
we will find these programs too.
So don't do it because you will get caught and you will get an F in the cou=
rse (this is cheating).
Don't look for code to use for your project on the web or from other studen=
ts (current or past).
Just do your project alone using the help given in this project description=
 and from your instructor and GTA only.
Finally, you should not post your code nor deploy your project on a public =
web site.
</p>
<h2>Platform</h2>
<p>
You will do this project on your own PC/laptop.
You need to install the <a href=3D"https://www.apachefriends.org/" target=
=3D"_top">XAMPP</a> web server,
which includes the Apache http web server, PHP, and MySQL. It's about 125MB=
s (775MBs after installation) and
can be installed on Windows, Linux, and OS X.
The installation directory is <tt>\xampp</tt> for Windows, <tt>/opt/lampp</=
tt> for Linux, and <tt>/Applications/XAMPP</tt> for OS X.
</p>
<p>
You will test the project on your PC/laptop using
the Mozilla Firefox web browser.
</p>
<h2>Setting up your project</h2>
<p>
Download the project2 files <a href=3D"https://lambda.uta.edu/cse5335/proje=
ct2.zip">project2.zip</a> and unarchive them inside your web server documen=
t root directory (ie, inside the <tt>htdocs</tt> sub-directory in the XAMPP=
 instalation directory). On Linux, you may have to do this as the root user=
.
</p>
<p>
The project2 directory contains 3 files: <tt>proxy.php</tt>, <tt>movies.htm=
l</tt>, and <tt>movies.js</tt>.
The proxy script <tt>proxy.php</tt> is used to
avoid the cross-domain restriction when using Ajax. All the web service req=
uests to TMDb
should go through this proxy. See the example in <tt>movies.js</tt>.
Your project is to edit <tt>movies.html</tt> and <tt>movies.js</tt> as desc=
ribed in the description of the web application.
</p>
<h2>Getting an access key from TMDb</h2>
<p>
You are going to use the Web Service REST API of the movie DB <a href=3D"ht=
tps://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api" target=3D"_top">TMDb</a>.
You first need to get an API access key from
<a href=3D"https://www.themoviedb.org/account/signup" target=3D"_top">Sign =
up a TMDb account</a>.
The access key will allow you to send web service requests to TMDb (maximum=
 3 requests per second).
</p><p>
After you get the API key, you put it in <tt>proxy.php</tt> and you
test your setup on your web browser by using the URL address:<br>
<a href=3D"http://localhost/project2/movies.html" target=3D"_top">http://lo=
calhost/project2/movies.html</a><br>
and by typing the title of your favorite movie.
This will display a list of movies that match this title in JSON form.
</p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>
The following web pages contain various tutorials. Use them as a
reference only. The class slides contain enough information on
AJAX.
</p><ul>
<li> <a href=3D"https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started" target=
=3D"_top">The Movie Database API</a></li>
<li> <a href=3D"http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_ajax_intro.asp" target=3D"_t=
op">AJAX Tutorial</a></li>
<li> <a href=3D"http://www.cs.rochester.edu/courses/210/spring2011/lectures=
/012/" target=3D"_top">Ajax</a></li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h2>Description of the Web Application</h2>
<p>
Your project is to develop a web application to get information about movie=
s, their cast, their posters, etc.
This application should be developed using plain JavaScript and Ajax.
You should not use any JavaScript library, such as JQuery.
Note that everything should be done asynchronously and your web page should=
 never be redrawn/refreshed completely.
This means that the buttons or any other input element in your HTML forms m=
ust have JavaScript actions,
and should not be regular HTTP requests.
</p>
<p>
Your application should have a text section where one can type a movie titl=
e (eg, The Matrix),
one "<tt>Display Info</tt>" button to search, one section to display the se=
arch results,
and one section to display information about a movie.
The search results is an itemized clickable list of movie titles along with=
 their years they were released.
When you click on one of these movie titles, you display information about =
the movie:
the poster of the movie as an image,
the movie title, its genres (separated by comma),
the movie overview (summary),
and the names of the top five cast members (ie, actors who play in the movi=
e).
</p><p>
</p>
You need to use the following TMDb HTTP methods listed in <a href=3D"https:=
//developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started" target=3D"_top">The Movie Da=
tabase API</a>:
<ul>
<li> <a href=3D"https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/search/search-movies">/=
3/search/movie</a>: Search for movies by title.</li>
<li> <a href=3D"https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/movies">/3/movie/{id}</=
a>: Get the basic movie information for a specific movie id.</li>
<li> <a href=3D"https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/movies/get-movie-credit=
s">/3/movie/{id}/credits</a>: Get the cast and crew information for a speci=
fic movie id.</li>
</ul>
You need to call the TMDb web service through the <tt>proxy.php</tt>.
For example, to get information about the movie "The Matrix" (which has id =
603), you use the HTTP call
<tt>proxy.php?method=3D/3/movie/603</tt> (it doesn't need the API key -- it=
's already in the proxy).
To search for the movie "matrix", you call
<tt>proxy.php?method=3D/3/search/movie&amp;query=3Dmatrix</tt>.
<p></p>
<p>
Note that there is a lot of information returned by these web services.
You need to use very few parts of this information only.
</p>
<p></p>
<h2>What to Submit</h2>
<p>
After you make sure that your programs runs correctly, zip your project2 di=
rectory.
Use the form below to submit your <tt>project2.zip</tt>file.=20
We do not accept email or hardcopy submissions. You may submit multiple fil=
es, if you like, as
long as they have different names. These files are automatically
uploaded directly into your personal class account for this particular
project, so you don't have to include your name or student ID or
project number in the file name. You may submit your files as many
times as you like, but only the most recently submitted files will be
retained and evaluated (newly submitted files replace the old files
under the same file name). After you submit the files, please
double-check that your submitted files are correct by clicking on the
8Status link and look the submitted files.
